# Wishlist static page

This repository holds a single-page wishlist site (`index.html`). Follow the steps below to view, edit, and publish it as a GitHub Page so friends and family can see it.

## What's inside
- **Hero + anchor nav** – quick blurb plus jump links to every section so shoppers can land where they need instantly.
- **Quick Preferences (`#preferences`)** – sizing, colour, and style notes.
- **Gift Radar (`#gift-radar`)** – grid of all requested presents with links and helper notes.
- **Room & Interest Inspo / Brands / Helpful Extras / Inspiration** – additional reference lists that cover décor cues, favourite labels, coordination tips, and fallback ideas.

## 1. Preview locally
1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Double-click `index.html` (or open it from your browser via `File > Open`), and the entire wishlist renders instantly—no build tools are required.

## 2. Customize the content
Update the text directly inside `index.html`:
- **Hero + anchor nav**: adjust the intro sentence and the nav link labels/destinations if you rename sections.
- **Quick Preferences**: set your intro, favorite styles, colors, and notes.
- **Gift Radar**: each `<article class="gift-card">` block is one gift. Edit the title, description, and optional link.
- **Interest, brand, and helper sections**: add or remove list items to match your tastes.

> Tip: keep the structure the same so the existing CSS continues to style everything nicely.

## 3. Publish with GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repo and push these files.
2. In the repo settings, enable **GitHub Pages** (choose branch `main` / folder `/ (root)`).
3. GitHub will give you a public URL (e.g., `https://yourname.github.io/wishlist`). Share that link for birthday or Christmas shopping.

Whenever you update `index.html`, commit and push again; GitHub Pages automatically refreshes your public site.
