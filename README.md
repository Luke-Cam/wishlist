# Wishlist static page

This repository holds a single-page wishlist site (`index.html`). Follow the steps below to view, edit, and publish it as a GitHub Page so friends and family can see it.

## 1. Preview locally
1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Double-click `index.html` (or open it from your browser via `File > Open`), and the entire wishlist renders instantly—no build tools are required.

## 2. Customize the content
Update the text directly inside `index.html`:
- **Hero + Quick Preferences**: set your intro, favorite styles, colors, and notes.
- **Gift Radar**: each `<article class="gift-card">` block is one gift. Edit the title, description, and optional link.
- **Music & Artists / Brands / Current Obsessions**: add or remove list items to match your tastes.
- **Helpful Extras & Inspiration**: tweak sizes, shopping tips, and ideas.

> Tip: keep the structure the same so the existing CSS continues to style everything nicely.

## 3. Publish with GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repo and push these files.
2. In the repo settings, enable **GitHub Pages** (choose branch `main` / folder `/ (root)`).
3. GitHub will give you a public URL (e.g., `https://yourname.github.io/wishlist`). Share that link for birthday or Christmas shopping.

Whenever you update `index.html`, commit and push again; GitHub Pages automatically refreshes your public site.
